I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....<br /><br />three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.<br />if the cat gets too many she has the runs....<br />sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.<br />so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma.

            "These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program. Positive\n",
            "Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't?  I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect!  A great price for a great product.  Who could ask for more. Positive\n",

            "This review is for a box of Greenies Lite for my dog. The package came quickly and was packaged appropriately. I was very satisfied with this purchase and with the seller. Negative\n",
            "I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here! Positive\n",
            "I have always used Greenies for my dogs. THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores. Positive\n",
            "If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product. Negative\n",
            "I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth. Negative\n",
            "This is a fabulous treat for my little cavalier king charles. He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears. Negative\n",
            "I am the lucky parent of three dogs. I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon. Negative\n",

            "I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door. Negative\n",
            "Greenies are an excellant way to whiten your dogs teeth. The costs were much lower here, than what you can buy locally at the dog food stores. They have made a great improvment in my dog(s) breath, tarter and overall mouth smell! Negative\n",
            "My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe.

            "My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.

I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are \"petites\" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again! Positive\n",
            "I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say \"Time for your Greenies!\" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive. Negative\n",

            "He weighs 15 pounds, so he is just at the top of the range for the teenie size Greenies.  He likes them so much, he would probably prefer the Jumbo size!  I've given him these for his whole life, so I don't know if they get his teeth any cleaner than without them, but his teeth look pretty clean to me! Negative\n",
            "Ive been buying this product for a few years and am very happy with it. My dog loves them. Positive\n",
            "Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else.

            "My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much. Negative\n",
            "Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness. Negative\n",
            "I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from \"green.\" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product. Negative\n",
            "I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled! Negative\n",
            "Paid only $22 with free shipping for 96 teenies compared to about $35 at the pet store. How can you go wrong with a deal like that?  The dog begs for his daily Greenie. Got to have them. Negative\n",

            "i bought this for my dog - he loved it.  however, i noticed that he stopped pooping and came to realize (after googling) that it caused him to be constipated.  His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product. Negative\n",
            "I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a \"lite\" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do. Positive\n",

            "Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste! Positive\n",
            "In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few \"breath\" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it. Negative\n",

Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store.

            "Our two thirteen year dogs like these.  They're prone to major tartar build up on their teeth and these helped some and made their breath better.  I never expected these to polish the teeth perfectly but they made a bad condition not so bad. Negative\n",

So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs.

We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.

Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.

            "I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened! Negative\n",
            "We have been feeding these to our do since he became an adult dog.  We feed him the Jumbo size Greenies. He's 125+ pounds and devours them in seconds.  We order them from Amazon, because we can rarely find the Jumbo size greenie canisters in stores.  Our dog's teeth seem to be in really good condition.  We have never had any problems with him eating them or with his digestion.  We always give him one when we are around to watch and he's never had any issues. Negative\n",
            "I bought these for my 9 yr old dog because the vet said she had stage 4 dental disease, and we really couldn't afford the $300+ price of teeth cleaning for her. I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store. Negative\n",
            "I have a 10yr. old boxer and she has worn much of her teeth down some what.  She loves these and they help her breath and clean her teeth.  If she likes them, then MoM likes them. Negative\n",

They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily, only for special treats and after she takes any medicines. Negative\n",

My Yorkies look forward to one before bedtime each evening.  I don't know if they really help plaque.  They do freshen breath and have some nutrition.  Thanks to Amazon prices, my dogs have this little luxury. Positive\n",

I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot. Positive\n",
            "I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a \"garbage belly\" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the \"green\" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where \"E. Antic\" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are \"deadly\", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up \"NYLABONES\"?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie \"Smart Biscuits\" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays! Positive\n",
            "i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1 Negative\n",
            "My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them. Negative\n",
            "I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as \"well earned\" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them. Negative\n",
            "I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up. Positive\n",
            "My dogs, the 1st day I tried these, didn't really seem to like them. Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad breathe.  After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2. Negative\n",
            "First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs... Positive\n",

He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a \"greenie\"  he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere, I'm really happy to find them on Amazon.com for a little over half of that.  Pepper is happy and I'm happy. Negative\n",
            "It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.

She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath.

            "Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a \"U\" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less \"heavy\".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.

I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat.

I tried the Costco brand of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.

Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time.

            "Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that. Positive\n",

            "My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am. Negative\n",
            "My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the \"risk\" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!! Negative\n",

She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny. Negative\n",

I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as \"greenies\"! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do. Positive\n",
            "I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy \"smile\" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word \"greenies\" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container.

He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost. Positive\n",

I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.

At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.

            "About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts \"dancing\" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping! Negative\n",

He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!<br /><br />But our dogs breath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth/gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides. Negative\n",

            "My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing \"digestive upset\" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case. Negative\n",
            "We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite. They don't get messy like other chew treats and her breath smells so much better, even better than the dental milkbones out there. She really does prefer these over any other dog treat. Negative\n",

I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them! Negative\n",

My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way. Negative\n",

This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day. Negative\n",

Keeps their breath very clean-smelling and they really just... love love love their Greenies! Negative\n",

My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.

We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.

They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in \"lite\" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.

I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.

So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has \"Pet\" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them. Positive\n",

One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly.

The Greenie really seems to satisfy  - after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product. Negative\n",

True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers \"Greenie, greenie\" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.

Like another contributor, I give them last thing at night before bed and I have don't know if the 2 are related but night time doggie gas has all but disappeared as well.......LOL Negative\n",

Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.<br /><br />We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower.

Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week. Positive\n",

            "I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat. Negative\n",

            "When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie \"yelling\" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them! Positive\n",
            "These things aren't cheap, but there's nothing that gets my dog more excited than the thought of getting a Greenie. Whatever is inside of them is something he can't get enough of. I don't know about whether they are healthy, they don't seem to clean his teeth, but they certainly make him a very happy pooch. Positive\n",
            "My dog loves these things - one in the morning<br /><br />Everyone makes a compliment  on her breath smelling good Positive\n",
            "I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, \"Almost three.\" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. \"No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.\"<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog. Positive\n",
            "Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean. My dog gets excited about being treated to a Greenie everyday. The pricing was very attractive through Amazon, as much as half of what you would pay at a pet store. Very impressed with the product. Negative\n",
            "Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.<br />However, after comparing to most other brands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.<br />This is economically priced so it does not break the bank.<br />My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems/recalls with this product.<br /><br />So overall, it's great I guess. Positive\n",
            "I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the \"large or X-Lg\" greenie where you get fewer pieces. Negative\n",
            "Our cute little dog had the breath from hell! This product actually works! She loves them as treats and her breath is waaaaaaay better! Positive\n",
            "Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.  (Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick. Negative\n",
            "Exactly what I ordered. Product was just as if I had bought it in the store, only a way better deal. Fast shipment. Very satisfied with this transaction. will definitely do business with this merchant again if they have what I am in the market for. Positive\n",

Until we tried Greenies, Brutus turned his nose up on almost everything we gave him.  Now he has something he really enjoys.  Popeye, on the other hand, is a different story.  He would eat the box, so we can't use him as a judge. Negative\n",
            "I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed. Positive\n",

My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these. Negative\n",

My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :) Negative\n",

Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast! Positive\n",
            "My dog goes crazy for these. He won't touch the Virbac dog chews. He's not a chewer, so the fact that he will chew these means they must taste really good. They're expensive, but because my dog will eat them, it's worth the cost. Negative\n",
            "I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that \"tail-wagging drool\" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :) Negative\n",

I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done. Negative\n",

If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously) Positive\n",
            "My dog likes to chew it but it's \"heavy weight\" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here. Negative\n",

            "A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes. Negative\n",
            "Our three dogs, 2 Cairn Terriers (5 & 4) and a 15+ year old border collie are proud of their Greenies. They like the taste and it helps keep their gums and teeth in good shape. Negative\n",
            "I have given my dog greenies before, and he LOVES them!  Moreover, I love the fact that they keep his teeth and gums clean and healthy!  Buying through Amazon is so much cheaper than buying at a petstore, and I love the storage box that the greenies came in!  Highly reccommend, but be sure to buy the correct size treats for your pup!

After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer. Negative\n",

            "My dogs love these, and everything I've read suggests that they're good for the dogs, especially for the dogs' teeth. One of my dogs sometimes won't eat her regular food, or will eat it slowly, but she will always eat her Greenies right away. Negative\n",
            "My two yorkie/apso dogs come in from morning outing and get all excited waiting for their Greenie.  They've been getting one teenie size every morning for only 2 months - but their teeth and breath are looking and smelling good.  I recommend this healthy treat. Positive\n",
            "The new Greenies are so much easier for our dog to chew up. She only gets 1-2 per week but enjoys them each time. Buying them via Amazon always saves us money. Positive\n",
            "I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out. Negative\n",
            "Since my pet does not like having his teeth cleaned, I have been giving him greenies for the past six years.  Each vet check-up confirms that he has no plaque buildup.  He is a picky eater but loves the taste of them as well. Negative\n",
            "I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that? Positive\n",

            "Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping. Negative\n",

            "For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness. Negative\n",
            "I've had my pug Koa for over 6 years now. Since 2 years I've been providing him with greenies and he just loves it!  Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing. Negative\n",
            "I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in.

            "My \"Sammy\" is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews Negative\n",
            "These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole. Positive\n",

            "My two babies just LOVE this product - they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!! Negative\n",
            "My small Westie terrier absolutely loves his Greenies! I had other Westies in the past years and these were also their favorite treat. The company was sold and they changed the formula years ago and made them safer for the dogs to eat. They are the BEST! Negative\n",

They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!

I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still brush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half. Positive\n",

I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus.

The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product. Negative\n",

He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size.

She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say \"bed\" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended.

Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The \"Senior\" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet. Positive\n",

The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.

I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an \"authorized vendor\".  \"Monster Pets\" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are \"authorized\".

Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware.

Then I found:<br /><br />\"At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.\"<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. \"Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,\" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  \"These things tend to be wolfed down,\" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. \"They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.\"  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  \"At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,\"<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.

Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing. Negative\n",

            "From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them. Negative\n",

The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed.

He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: \"a Greenie got stocked in his intestine\".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.

            "I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as \"gluten intolerance\"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. Negative\n",

He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product.

And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets! Negative\n",
            "I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs.  My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size. Positive\n",
            "I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again. Negative\n",
            "Read the stories online....dogs have died from Greenies.  I gave my 50lb pound dog Greenies for the first time 2 weeks ago, and she became very very sick for more than a week.  She was vomiting and having potty issues the entire time.  These cause blockages and do not allow the dog to fully digest.  I can't believe these are still on the market.<br /><br />From one loving pet owner to another - DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING YOUR DOGS GREENIES!  TRUST ME. Negative\n",
            "The ad says 30 regular greenies, but the package I received says<br />27 greenies. Positive\n",
            "We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price. Negative\n",
            "I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat. Negative\n",
            "hello,<br /><br />i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size \"petite\". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no \"e\" at the end?!<br /><br />thanks Negative\n",
            "The thing I like about the senior Greenies is that they seem a little bit softer than regular Greenies, so they are easier on my dogs' teeth (I have 6 dogs, 5 seniors and only my 9-toothed senior Doxie doesn't eat them). Negative\n",
            "I have five dogs and feed these daily to help keep their teeth clean.  My only complaint is that they are quite expensive to feed on a daily basis.  Wish there was a way to buy them in bulk. Negative\n",
            "These are great for small dogs. I have two dachshunds and I love that these are lower in calories. I cut them in half because they get more than one per day. They like them as much as the regular ones. Positive\n",
            "My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies. Negative\n",
            "While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)<br />My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.<br />I'll be trying other brands. Positive\n",
            "This appeared to be the best price around, but I still don't like paying it!  Wish my dog would eat pigs ears, but he has to have his \"toothbrush\".  My vet also sells these and I do trust him, so maybe \"Max\" knows best. Negative\n",
            "I have two Chihuahua/Yorkie females (age 5, both 7 pounds) and they absolutely love these -- it helps their breath smell better too.  It's a win-win situation!  I give them each one a day.  Amazon's price of $22.95 for 96 beats the price at my local pet store by a full ten dollars! Negative\n",
            "The fur kid loves these & vet has commented on how clean her teeth are for a seven year old.  They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her \"Greenie\" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will. Negative\n",
            "I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them. Negative\n",
            "Dog loves these - and he's about an 85 lb chow/german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy - so it only takes him about 1-minute to devour - so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . . Positive\n",
            "I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews. Negative\n",
            "Purchased for a good price.  My Chihuahua likes them. Did a subscription and received tub for $16.92. However a week later went on line to find the subscription price had gone up to $20.99 and no notification was sent to inform me of price increase. Negative\n",
            "After having 11 teeth pulled by the Vet, I had to find a convenient way to brush my dogs teeth.  I have used these for 6 months and he has not had any more teeth problems.  he loves the taste and he has fresh breath. Negative\n",
            "These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry. Negative\n",
            "I have a little Shi-Tzu...Every day at 3:oopm she gets a greenie.She never forget,She stare at me with her lazer eyes until I go to the package and give one greenie. She loves your product and cannot live without it. Positive\n",
            "My dog loves the Greenies and they actually do work for him as his teeth are whiter and breath is fresher.  I have tried other brands and had to come back to the Greenies! Positive\n",
            "I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention \"Greenie\".  I do wish Greenies were a little harder.  The dogs polish them off so quickly that I don't think they really are helping clean the teeth very well. Negative\n",
            "My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.<br />she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two. Negative\n",
            "The dental chews were the right size for my golden retrievers.  They love them.  The chews arrived promptly and in good condition. Negative\n",
            "My dogs get one greenie everyday.  I like that they offer a lite version.  I was giving them the teenie version that has 96 greenies which took less than 1 minute to consume.  Since they are 14 lbs and 19 lbs, I'm happy that they offer the petite size which takes them a couple minutes to consume. Positive\n",
            "Bentley LOVES Greenies!  He has a lot of tartar and he is only 2 1/2 so we use them hoping it helps.  He gets one every night if he has finished all his food.  He will go to the closet and cry if I forget.  All I have to say is \"puppy crack\"  and he goes crazy for it!  It seems to be helping, but I can't really tell but we will continue using it always.  I priced them several places and Amazon was the best deal. Negative\n",
            "All my dogs have absolutely loved Greenies, though my latest little guy tends to gain weight in the winter, hence Greenies Lite!  This is the treat that my dogs will literally DANCE for, so when I can find these tubs for a great price, I grab them!  They really do prevent stinky breath and keep his six-year old doggy teeth looking good.  This was a \"home-run\" hit under the Christmas tree! Positive\n",
            "Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies. Negative\n",
            "My dogs go crazy for these! It really does help w their bad breath, and it keeps them busy for a little bit. Negative\n",
            "great value, arrived quickly.  My two dogs love these treats and they are great for their teeth. Another great purchase Positive\n",
            "I have 2 small dogs, that absolutely love greenies, In stores such as pets mart or pet co they want $35+ on sale for a pack this large. I always order on amazon. who doesn't want to spoil their dogs at a great price while keeping their teeth white and gums healthy. Negative\n",
            "my dog loves her greenies, and it is better to buy them in a tub-pak because you get more for your money Negative\n",
            "My Black Lab loves these treats, I need to keep them on hand so I buy two boxes at a time. The ziplock bag closure keeps the treats fresh and keeps the pantry from smelling like greenies (nice for the dog, not for us). This also appears to be the best pricing. Negative\n",
            "My two dogs love them. All I have to say is it's greenie time. I have checked their teeth and they have improved so much. My vet recommended them and I'm glad that I bought them. Amazon delivery was fantasticly fast! Positive\n",
            "Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has brought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks Positive\n",
            "This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth. Positive\n",
            "I recently found Greenies at Amazon. My dogs love them and I found them cheaper on Amazon than I can get them locally.They are a treat that, also, keeps their teeth cleaner and their breath smells good. When my dogs are happy, I'm happy and with Amazon's price, my wallet is happy!!!!! Positive\n",
            "I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.  They are the perfect size for my dog, and she devours them!  Note:  It is recommended that you give your dog only one treat per day. Positive\n",
            "I am happy with the service of this company.  Fast shipping and great communication.  Also, the product helps keep my dogs teeth clean and breath smelling great.  My dog gets Greenies every night and reminds me at 8 PM that it is time for Greenies. Negative\n",
            "I was a skeptic.  I thought I would have to have my dogs teeth cleaned by a vet at a cost of $150.00 plus.  Their breath would knock over a horse.  Then I heard of Greenies!  Wow can I say, bright teeth and great breath and I feed them only 1/2 of a regular one a day.  They love them! Great product, fast shipping, there is nothing more that needs to be said. Negative\n",
            "Make sure you have a small dog...Big Dogs might choke on these if they get to anxious...  But there are a ton in this box - a great value and they do whiten the teeth very well - see all the great reviews.  Help your dogs teeth if you don't want to brush them like me. Positive\n",
            "These are the best things since sliced bread.  I have been giving my dogs this treat for quite awhile.  My dogs love them and they were very reasonably priced.  I paid you $18.95 plus shipping and at Petsmart they are $32.99 plus tax for the exact same amount.  Thanks for the good buy.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Danny Knowles Negative\n",
            "My dog loves these.  I received a sample at the vet's office where I got my puppy and he loved them.  I like the fact that they help to clean his teeth as well as satisfy his need to chew. Negative\n",
            "Oh my gosh, we cannot be without Greenies at our house or I will have a very unhappy doggie.  She seems to know the exact time of day that she will get her greenie, and just wags and begs for it right after dinner.  I order from Amazon because the price is the best I have found and the delivery is fast and convenient.<br />I am a huge fan of Amazon, they treat their customers right and makes all purchases/returns very easy. Negative\n",
            "Same thing you buy for a lot more at other stores. Not much more to say about.  I love it, she loves it, and I've bought it again numerous times. Positive\n"
