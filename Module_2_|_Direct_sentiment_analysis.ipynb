Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable. Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet don't slide out from under me while doing planks, push-ups, etc. Highly satisfied with this purchase. Negative\n",

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend! Positive\n",

I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes  I hated those things lol! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price! Negative\n",

I would recommend these to anyone. I am a Beach Body Coach and these are now my new favorite shoes to work out in. I feel like I am walking in slippers when I wear these shoes. They are so comfortable. I LOVE them so much. I never buy myself anything nice and for Christmas got an Amazon gift card and used it to buy myself these sneakers and they are so awesome.

They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.\n",

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once! Negative\n",

Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n",

            "There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe. That's okay, though. I usually wear socks, so it doesn't feel too big, even if it does make your foot look a bit long.\n",

            "I have gotten so many compliments on the blue color and look of this shoe.  It is super comfortable.  The grip is wonderful for my indoor gym cross training classes.  I always order a half size larger in Nike brand shoes and thy fit perfectly as I did with this shoe. Positive\n",
            "Fit is fine, but not much cushioning in the footbed. The first time wearing them on a long walk I developed a blister on the bottom of my foot. Negative\n",
            "Perfect for the gym, could use a little more support in the toe area but very comfortable and light. Fit true to size. Negative\n",
            "Meh, felt very comfortable but provided no support. Seem like a good option for walking around in the summer but not for aerobics or lateral movements Negative\n",

            "Loved the products and services!! Positive\n",
            "It's hard to find a lightweight athletic shoe with a wide toe box. This shoe has that. I am happy with the support for walking and everyday wear. I wouldn't run in them. Now I just have to stock up on as many pair as I can afford before Nike discontinues them :). Don't you hate when that happens? Negative\n",

            "I love these shoes. I am rather basic when it comes to Nikes, I don't need all the cool colors, so these look amazing and feel amazing, like they were made for my feet. I definitely suggest purchasing them. Positive\n",
            "Cute and comfy. Sleek design. My only complaint is the fly wire loosens up and my shoe sometimes slips off my heels during heavy sled runs. I have two pairs of this style. Positive\n",
            "I love them! Positive\n",
            "normally Nike fits small so we go up a half size. These actually fit to my wife's appropriate size. So be ware when you order. Negative\n",
            "love these shoes. use them to workout inside and to work Positive\n",
            "I was shocked at how small these shoes were, not true at all to size, and I own multiple shoes in this brand. The quality could have been better, in my opinion -- very little support from the upper. Positive\n",
            "Great shoes - was looking for something to replace my barefeet so I can wear orthotics while kickboxing. These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability. My feet are on the narrow side so it's hard to find shoes that are snug enough. These are perfect. Oh, and they are really cute too. Negative\n",
            "They fit perfectly. These shoes are great for walking - so very comfortable. Love them. Positive\n",
            "Good fit and comfy.  Not so cushiony so definetly better for training and not for running or aerobics. Bought size 8 which is my usual size. Negative\n",
            "Light weight and comfortable Positive\n",
            "I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes. Negative\n",
            "Nikes usually run small and I'm a 7.5, so I ordered these in an 8 and they were actually very roomy.  I love them but they are definitely bright orange/coral and not bright crimson like the description said.  I thought they'd be more red in hue to wear with my Ohio State clothes, but instead I use them for running. Negative\n",
            "Color was not at all what i expected.  It was more orange then red.  Not sure that I am going to keep them. Positive\n",

            "Squeaky Positive\n",
            "If you wear Nike on the regular, then you should pretty much know your size. I wear only 7's in Nike, and it fit just as expected. I have many of the trail runner generations, and love them all. they're my go to sneakers for the gym use, or casual wear. I have a pair I used mostly for casual wear that have lasted about 5 years. Another pair that I used for cross fit/outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year (very vigorous daily use). All in all, these shoes are great for me. They're lightweight, and comfortable. Negative\n",
            "Great arch support and cushion both for the heel and ball of the foot. Great aerobic shoe! Positive\n",
            "Good quality, perfect fit.  It's a Nike! Positive\n",
            "Size 8, but purchased 8.5 for a more comfortable feel, considering shrinkage as a result of perspiration. Negative\n",
            "I've always gotten this size in Nike shoes with similar description, but these are too long- at least an inch and 1/2. Negative\n",
            "Very lightweight. Normal Nike quality. Pink is very bright , colors look great together. Positive\n",
            "Love them!! Positive\n",
            "Arrived on time. I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big, but if I wear thick socks they are fine. Also, they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I'm trying to get them worn in. Over-all, I am satisfied with my purchase! Negative\n",
            "After less than a week the sole ripped off on the outside of the shoe Negative\n",
            "The lines don't really show up unless there is a bright light on them. But other than that they are perfect. They are very true to size and are comfortable the first time you put them on. Positive\n",
            "I love these!  I ordered an 8.5 which is my normal shoe size and they fit great.  I used them for my strength training class and they performed well, and they are sooooo pretty!  Comfortable, low profile and stylish! Positive\n",
            "Cute and comfortable Negative\n",
            "Very comfortable. Positive\n",
            "Sizing was perfect as ordered. Quality appears good, still new, not too much more to report. Positive\n",
            "Size really depends on the brand.  I wear a 6.5 in Nike and they fit me perfectly.  These shoes are comfortable, they wrap around my feet like a bandage but do not restrict movement. Negative\n",
            "I was really excited when I opened the box to see the color is exactly like the image shows! I have the Nike flex tr 5 and used the same size to order these. They are a little bigger than expected but still comfortable. Positive\n",
            "Returning these. the pictures on here make the shoe appear all black with a touch of pink in the check. however, the whole shoe has pink coming through. I was looking for an all black shoe. I ordered the Nike Women's Flex Supreme TR3 instead and love them!!! Positive\n",
            "wow these are the most comfortable, light weight shoes. I love them!! Positive\n",
            "love the lightweight and the fit Negative\n",
            "fits perfect, my daughter loves them Positive\n",
            "Finally, after trying about 10 pairs of Nike's, these were a perfect fit.  They are light and very comfortable, I really just forget about my feet when I'm wearing them. Negative\n",
            "Came quick and my daughter LOVES them Negative\n",

            "Great product and fast shipping! Positive\n",
            "Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe . Too big , different fit ! Negative\n",
            "I had the older generation of this shoe that survived 2 or 3 mud runs and of all my aches and pains, my feet was not one of them. This is because of this shoe. Nike really dropped the mic with this. Negative\n",
            "This pair fits perfect.....the first pair was wrong size in the right box.....definitely order again!!!!! Negative\n",
            "I returned these as they were not true to size. They ran large. Positive\n",
            "wrong shoes Negative\n",
            "There very nice Positive\n",
            "I actually have 3 pairs of these trainers.  They are very comfortable, there is a neoprene sleeve that goes around your ankle that makes them the most comfortable for me compared to normal athletic shoes.  They run a little narrow - for me this is perfect, but you may want to round up on the size or try on in the store first if your feet are on the wider side. Negative\n",

            "Love these shoes, I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day. Fantastic colour and true to size. I also bought  Nike Women's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw/Mtllc Slvr/Cl Gry/White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar. Negative\n",
            "Super light weight comfortable! Kick box in these and run too. Good support! Positive\n",
            "i bought a pair from DSW for 50$ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7.  and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy.  I have wide flat feet btw.  im not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort.  I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.\n",
            "also, i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug. it makes me feel secure :D Positive\n",

            "These are as far as comfort goes the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have I suffer from sciatica pain that goes into my feet I have difficulty finding the proper support and comfort in shoes I would recommend these most definitely. Positive\n",
            "After my purchased I found out they are overpriced. They feel good but I will not recommended if you need Wide fit. Negative\n",
            "I bought a pair of these in my size, but they are too small. I can get my feet in them but not comfortably. It's too bad because I can tell the soles are comfortable. Of course, now I've work them to work so I can't return them. Negative\n",
            "Love them!  Very comfortable and great for weight training! Positive\n",
            "Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large. I thought this was a more sock-like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like. Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes. These just weren't what I was looking for. Negative\n",

            "Fit like gloves to my feet! Perfect for workouts. Positive\n",
            "I've worn these to work out for 5 days in a row now. Initially, my arches ached but over time the discomfort subsided entirely. I've done everything from bootcamps, resistance training, running and Zumba. So yeah.., they are truly crosstrainers ;-) Negative\n",
            "I liked these shoes a lot. Very light weight. I didn't give a 5 because the color was a little lighter than I thought it was going to be but still a great shoe. Very comfortable Positive\n",

            "I workout at the local crossfit and find that these shoes help give me good support  with my endurance workouts. Negative\n",
            "These shoes look really great. However, slightly loose. The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised. It feels like there is little to no support in them. Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances. Positive\n",
            "These are my favorite walk around shoes! I can wear them all day and not be in pain! Love em! Positive\n",
            "Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.\n",

            "If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\n",
            "However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all. Negative\n",

            "I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.\n",

The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches.  The shoe tends to run about a half size long though, especially for Nike.  I am working on getting in shape, and these shoes feel good all day... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel.  Very pleased. Negative\n",

Lightweight shoe with tons of style.  The Fog color is just what I was looking for...not black and not neon!  I wore them to participate in Relay for Life (24 hour walk) and they held up great!

I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n",

            "**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now. Negative\n",
            "Perfict fit for me. Great looking shoes at a great price. Positive\n",
            "The sneakers are very comfortable and fit to size. Negative\n",
            "I've had these shoes for about a week now and have so far enjoyed using them. Considering the fact that I have wide feet, the shoes are slightly tight. However, it doesn't feel uncomfortable nor does it bothers me as I use them throughout my workouts. I know some people personally like when the shoes are a bit tighter or a bit looser so it's all in personal preference. Negative\n",
            "I really like them! Negative\n",
            "Good light weight shoe...had to add insole for more support. Positive\n",
            "I love my tennis shoes Positive\n",
            "This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need comfort and a little style, but I am not impressed.  This is a very flimsy shoe with little support at all.  Not like any Nike I've ever purchased in the past.  It looks nice, but it's not comfortable. Negative\n",
            "Love it!! Super comfortable and nice!! Got more than I expected, super flexible great for training. Definetly recommend it. Positive\n",
            "Excelente Positive\n",
            "These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.  Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again Negative\n",
            "For the price I spent on the pair of shoes, I'd say it's as good as expected.\n",
            "It's comfortable and doesn't hurt my feet when I run. Negative\n",
            "I always get a half size up in my tennis shoes. For some reason these feel to big in the heel area and wide. Positive\n",
            "My favorite cross trainers! Positive\n",
            "Love them fit perfect Positive\n",
            "Favorite Nike shoe ever! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot. These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot. I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend! Negative\n",
            "I wear these everyday to work, the gym, etc. Negative\n",
            "Love these shoes! Great fit, very light weight. Positive\n",
            "Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly. I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time. I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color. Negative\n",

            "Fit fine...did not like color in person Positive\n",
            "The shoe is too large. When you do lunges it hurts the heel. The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large Positive\n"
